# managed

This library contains the `Managed` monad, which is a small building block for
wrapping resources that you acquire in an exception-safe way using a callback.

The `Managed` type is really simple::

```haskell
newtype Managed a = Managed { with :: forall r . (a -> IO r) -> IO r }
```

... and it's a special case of two other monads:

```
Managed a = Codensity IO a = forall r . ContT r IO a
```

The main reason for defining a separate type is to simplify inferred types and
to provide additional type class instances.  Also, the `Managed` monad has a
less intimidating name so I feel more comfortable using it to teach beginners.

The most useful feature of `Managed` is that it automatically lifts the `Monoid`
and `Num` type classes.  All `Applicative`s can auto-lift these two type classes
and by chaining `Applicative`s you can extend types with new functionality while
still preserving their `Monoid` and `Num` operations.

This type was popularized by the `mvc` library, and I received several requests
to split this type out into a small and separate library.

## Quick Example

Install [`stack`](http://haskellstack.org/) and run:

    $ stack install managed pipes

Then compile and run the following small program which copies `"inFile.txt"` to
`"outFile.txt"`:

```haskell
import Control.Monad.Managed
import System.IO
import Pipes
import qualified Pipes.Prelude as Pipes

main = runManaged $ do
    hIn  <- managed (withFile "inFile.txt" ReadMode)
    hOut <- managed (withFile "outFile.txt" WriteMode)
    liftIO $ runEffect $ Pipes.fromHandle hIn >-> Pipes.toHandle hOut
```

```bash
$ stack ghc -- -O2 example.hs
$ cat inFile.txt
ABC
$ ./example
$ cat outFile.txt
ABC
```

Read the documentation in the `Control.Monad.Managed` module to learn more about
how to use the `Managed` type.

## Development Status

The API is mostly stable.  I might add a few utility functions later on that
wrap `withXXX` functions from `base` in the `Managed` monad, but for now I'm
waiting for people to reach a decision on split-`base` before adding these.

## How to contribute

* Use the `Managed` type in your own library

* Write tutorials explaining how to use this library
